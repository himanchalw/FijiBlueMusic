                The best music makes you think. Be it lyrically or melodically, the best music has a sense of mystery. If you have to ask, "What genre is this?" You're likely already hooked. Meet Fiji Blue, the genre-bending Los Angeles newcomers who are giving us all a run for our money. Comprised of Valentin Fritz and Trevor Dering, Fiji Blue's origin story begins on the east coast, in Boston to be exact. First meeting at the infamous Berklee School of Music, the duo quickly bonded over a shared love of music. But the boys didn't quite become Fiji Blue at exactly that moment.

            <p>The band fully took shape once they packed up and moved across the country to the city of angels. There they honed in on the Fiji Blue sound. Fritz started producing, while Trevor played guitar and sang. After setting aside time to hone in on their craft, they released their first single, "Indigo" in November of 2018. The tune is reminiscent of dark chocolate, rich and smooth and with it, the duo pushed forward with their genre-meshing, R&B downtempo sound.  </p>
